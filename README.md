# Knight Travails
A project in Ruby Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/knights-travails)

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.
The programm calculates the minimum moves needed to go from square START to square END by a chess knight (no, this is not a game).

This is a command line programm. You can view it online at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@Agathasta/knighttravails#README.md). 

Click on the green 'run' button at the top of the page. When prompted, enter the START and END coordinates.
